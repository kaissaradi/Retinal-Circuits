      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This website is a collection of projects and resources focused on exploring and analyzing retinal circuits based on the work of the Retinal circuits lab at UCLA.
        The Field Lab at UCLA (previously Duke) investigates how the retina processes information, focusing on the function and organization of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which are the output neurons of the retina. 
        The lab studies how RGCs adapt to different light levels and how their receptive fields change under different conditions. 
        They use a variety of techniques, including multi-electrode array recordings, computational modeling, and analysis of neural responses to visual stimuli. 
        Their work aims to understand the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception and how information from the retina is processed by downstream brain areas.

        <h3>Spike Trains</h3>
        <p>This Jupyter Notebook analyzes neuronal spike train data in response to light intensities. It explores two datasets: one from a single neuron under ten different light intensities, and another using a multi-electrode array. The analysis includes loading the data, visualizing histograms, bar charts, and creating raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs). 
          The goal is to understand how neurons react to light stimulation through detailed visualization and statistical summaries of spike timings.</p>

        <h3>Marmoset Data</h3>
        <p>This notebook provides an in-depth analysis of raw retinal neuron data. The data consists of spiking activity from neurons recorded under various experimental conditions. The notebook outlines the steps required to process the raw data, including data loading, spike extraction, and pre-processing for further analysis. The goal is to facilitate understanding of how raw neuronal data can be transformed into meaningful insights, particularly in the context of visual stimulus responses.</p>

        <h3>Cricket Hunting</h3>
        <p>This notebook presents a MATLAB program designed to detect when a mouse catches or kills a cricket in a video. Using computer vision techniques, the code tracks both the mouse and cricket, evaluating conditions such as distance and velocity to determine if a catch event has occurred. The notebook outlines the process of object detection, multi-object tracking, and visualization of results, making it adaptable for experiments requiring automated capture detection.</p>

        <h3>Parallel Processing</h3>
        <p>This page details a C-based project for parallel data collection from a multi-electrode array (MEA) system. It showcases a multi-threaded pipeline for data acquisition, processing, storage, and visualization in real-time. The system uses signal handling and threading to efficiently manage the high data rates from multiple electrodes, ensuring continuous operation until a manual interruption. The notebook provides code snippets for initialization and management of MEA data, enabling effective hardware integration and concurrent data processing.</p>

            Biophysical neural adaptation mechanisms enable deep learning models to capture dynamic retinal computation
          </a>
          <p>A new type of deep learning model, called the photoreceptor-convolutional neural network (PR-CNN), has been developed to better capture the dynamic computations of the retina. The PR-CNN incorporates a biophysical model of the photoreceptor, the first stage of visual processing in the eye, which allows the model to adapt its output to changing light levels. This is unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which struggle to generalize their predictions to new light levels. The PR-CNN was tested on recordings from both monkey and rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina. The model showed significant improvements in predicting RGC responses across a range of light levels, including those not seen during training. The PR-CNN also accurately predicted context-dependent changes in RGC sensitivity, which is the ability of RGCs to adjust their response gain to different stimuli. The model was further able to capture light-dependent changes in RGC response kinetics, which is the speed at which RGCs respond to stimuli. These findings suggest that the PR-CNN is a powerful new tool for understanding the dynamic computations of the retina and for developing more realistic models of the visual system.</p>

            Distribution and diversity of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in tree shrew
          </a>
          <p>The paper investigates the distribution and diversity of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in the tree shrew, a visually dominant animal that shares evolutionary ties with both rodents and primates. The authors used immunohistochemical methods to identify ipRGCs, revealing two previously described ipRGC types (M1-like and M2-like) as well as a novel type of ipRGC that co-expresses melanopsin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme in dopamine synthesis. The researchers found that these dopamine-producing ipRGCs are restricted to the ventral retina and are concentrated in the region of highest visual acuity. The study also found that the distribution of ipRGCs in the tree shrew retina is similar to that found in other mammals, with the exception of the dopamine-producing ipRGCs, which are unique to the tree shrew. The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of the evolution and function of ipRGCs in the mammalian retina.</p>
