            Biophysical neural adaptation mechanisms enable deep learning models to capture dynamic retinal computation
          </a>
          <p>A new type of deep learning model, called the photoreceptor-convolutional neural network (PR-CNN), has been developed to better capture the dynamic computations of the retina. The PR-CNN incorporates a biophysical model of the photoreceptor, the first stage of visual processing in the eye, which allows the model to adapt its output to changing light levels. This is unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which struggle to generalize their predictions to new light levels. The PR-CNN was tested on recordings from both monkey and rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina. The model showed significant improvements in predicting RGC responses across a range of light levels, including those not seen during training. The PR-CNN also accurately predicted context-dependent changes in RGC sensitivity, which is the ability of RGCs to adjust their response gain to different stimuli. The model was further able to capture light-dependent changes in RGC response kinetics, which is the speed at which RGCs respond to stimuli. These findings suggest that the PR-CNN is a powerful new tool for understanding the dynamic computations of the retina and for developing more realistic models of the visual system.</p>

            Distribution and diversity of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in tree shrew
          </a>
          <p>The paper investigates the distribution and diversity of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in the tree shrew, a visually dominant animal that shares evolutionary ties with both rodents and primates. The authors used immunohistochemical methods to identify ipRGCs, revealing two previously described ipRGC types (M1-like and M2-like) as well as a novel type of ipRGC that co-expresses melanopsin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme in dopamine synthesis. The researchers found that these dopamin
